## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.
The Pandas and pathlib libraries were used along with matplotlib and must be installed in order to run the program correctly.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.
Pathlib allows the import of files, in this case CSV data.
Matplotlib allows for the visualization of data in the form of plots and graphs.

This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The user will need to run the program in a code editor such as Juypter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

Documentation for the Pandas library can be found [here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Documentation for the pathlib library can be found[here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

Documentation for matplotlib can be found [here.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index)
